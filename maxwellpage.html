    <p class="woah">The night was stormy. The Kraiton Empire had never experienced such rain, despite it’s reputation as a marshy nation. Many people suspected that they angered some Rain Goddess, others blamed mages for interfering with weather, while others yet suggested it was just weather being weather. <br><br>
        In this night, a particularly well-dressed mage finally returned home. He had not been home, due several meetings with his peers. What annoyed him, is that he wasted most of his valuable time on trivial things, such as how tight the security of Recondria’s vaults is. In fact, this had annoyed him so much, that he was grumbling as the walked up the second flight of stairs. His umbrella hadn’t much use in this situation, as it could barely protect him. The rain had stained his suit. This wouldn’t have bothered him, if it wasn’t his favourite suit. <br>
        He quietly disenchanted the runes he had placed in order to lock the door, and proceeded to unlock the door. As he looked out to window to see the titanic waves nearly thrashing his window, he let out a sigh. This was not his type of day. He probably would have fallen into bed to read some of his favourite books (a particular one was “Fall of the Valkyrian Empire” by J. H. Ladwell), if he hadn’t have noticed the burning sensation on his neck, where the symbol was engraved, and the man reclined on his living room couch. <br> <br>

        “Hello Maxy.”  The man’s voice sounding like two pieces of coarse sandpaper rubbing against each other <br>
        “I would ask you how your day was, but I can plainly see that.” The man sat up into a more formal position as he adjusted his red wine tie.<br>
        “Oh, I’m wondering, is this going to be one of your visits where you just give me a quick riddle and then leave? Or is it one of those visits where you warn me about how I shouldn’t do what I’m doing?” Maxwell replied quite snarkily, and took off his wet coat.<br>
        The man with the red wine tie chuckled.
        “Oh, not at all. Not at all! But, I must admit, I’m quite entertained when I make those visits.” the man walked to the kitchen and brought a hot cup of pitch black coffee. <br>
        “I know you like them seasoned, but you’re running out of Nutmeg.” <br>
        “Hmph, thank you. Now, are you here to actually relax and chat on non-business grounds for once?” Maxwell replied, taking the cup of coffee. <br>
        “Heh, you know me. That’s never the case, Maxy boy.” The man’s eyes glinted scarlet in the dimly lit room: “Tell me, what interest do you have in those three?” <br>
        “You mean Zig, Rune and Cork?” Maxwell replied.<br>
        “Pff, who else? Yes, those three clowns.” the man jested. <br>
        “Hm. That’s quite a weird question. To be fair… I really do not know why.” <br>
        “Heh, guessed so. Seems they even have you fooled.”<br>
        Maxwell took a sip of his coffee. <br>
        “Good lord, this coffee is bitter. I think you owe me a question or two in return.” Maxwell’s mouth curved into a smirk. <br>
        “First of all, are you the one that engraved this poor work of runecraft into my neck?” <br>
        “My mouth is sealed on that topic, buddy. Wouldn’t want to anger them.” <br>
        “Can you not be cryptic for once?” Maxwell replied. <br>
        “Not a chance. I would recommend the same for you. Ooh, “I’ll see you in Recondria” or better yet, “We’ll talk about it in Kraiton”. I’m guessing that was your second question?” <br>
        “Caught me there.” <br>
        “Why do you associate yourself with the likes of Cassiopeia?” the man said as he stood up. <br>
        Maxwell sits down in his place and materializes some spices for the coffee. <br>
        “Don’t answer that. Small, little rhetorical question.” <br>
        “The Blight Armada is just a bunch of fools pretending to be gods in their futile view of the world.” <br>
        “What does it matter whether the Beyond wins over the rest of the multiverse?” <br>
        “Everything will be consumed by the Static or the Abyss anyways.” <br>
        “Are you being existential? That’s unlike you, Seth.” <br>
        “Heh, referring to me by my “mortal” name. Low blow, man.” <br>
        “Not that you would truly understand anything going on, but you’re much closer than they are.”<br>
        The man vanished in a bright scarlet light, leaving Maxwell alone. <br>
        “Lord, what a creep.” Maxwell grumbled all to himself, while partaking in his coffee.<br>
        <br>
        Nevertheless, he wouldn’t let the visit of a cryptic entity affect his plans. Not now. He was at the make or break part of his plan. Especially since he wasn’t sure whether he would survive.
